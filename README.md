Mental Health Evaluation During Internet Blackouts: A Case Study on the Bangladesh Quota Movement

Overview

This research project examines the impact of government-imposed internet blackouts on mental health, using the Bangladesh Quota Movement of July 2024 as a case study. During this political event, internet shutdowns were enforced to control the spread of unrest, which led to severe disruptions in communication, financial transactions, and access to vital services. This study delves into the emotional, behavioral, and environmental effects of such digital disconnection on affected individuals.
