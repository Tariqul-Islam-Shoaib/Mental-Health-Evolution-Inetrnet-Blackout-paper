Mental Health Evaluation During Internet Blackouts: A Case Study on the Bangladesh Quota Movement



This research examines the mental health impact of government-imposed internet blackouts during the Bangladesh Quota Movement of July 2024, which disrupted communication, financial transactions, and access to vital services. Using a 20-question survey completed by 192 participants, the study analyzed disruptions in internet use for academics, work, social media, and entertainment, categorizing stress levels from no stress to extreme stress. Findings reveal that the blackout significantly disrupted daily routines, with most participants experiencing moderate to extreme psychological distress. The study emphasizes the need for mental health support during internet shutdowns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and highlights the potential long-term emotional and societal challenges of such crises.
